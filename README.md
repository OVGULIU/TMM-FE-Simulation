# TMM-FE-Simulation
This repository is created for sharing ABAQUS material subroutines and finite element (FE) models for thermo-micro-mechanical (TMM) FE simulation of bulk metal forming processes

Before running FE simulation copy abaqus_v6.env file along with the suitable UMAT/VUMAT subroutine (.for/.f) file into the working directory of the FE model.

In case of using Linux, use abaqus_v6_Linux.env instead, but remove _Linux from the file's name. Moreover, the extension of subroutine files need to be changed to .f in case of using Linux ABAQUS.
