# TMM-FE-Simulation
This repository is created for sharing ABAQUS material subroutines and finite element (FE) models for thermo-micro-mechanical (TMM) FE simulation of bulk metal forming processes

Note: Before running FE simulation copy abaqus_v6.env file along with the suitable UMAT/VUMAT subroutine (.for) file into the working directory of the FE model.
